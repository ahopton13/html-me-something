                My name is Asha Hopton and I am from St. Louis, MO. Born and raised in St. Louis, I lived in Bel-Nor, across from University of Missouri - St. Louis. I enjoyed our neighborhood, having my best friend across the street, and the annual block parties with the community. I also enjoyed walking our family dog, Doobie, our sweet and energetic minitature schauzer.

                After graduating from Incarnate Word Academy, I moved to Columbia, MO to attend the University of Missouri - Columbia, to study biology to eventually become a pharmacist. Due to the struggles of Chemistry, I switched my major to Health Sciences and graduated in May 2018. In June, I started my first full time job at T-REX as an Event Coordinator. I'm surrounded by a wonderful staff who have become my family. Right now I'm in LC101 to gain coding skills to hopefully start a career in tech.
